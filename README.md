# bungee-app
This is my fully functioning Bungee-App, where user can create a profile (data is saved in a database),with login functions, where user is able to make a bungee jumping booking (also saved in the database). The front-end is made in React, the back-end i used Java with Spring framework, using Spring Boot and Spring Security. Its secured with JSON Web Token (JWT).
